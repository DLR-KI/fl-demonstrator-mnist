# Federated Learning Demonstrator MNIST Example

This is a small Python package designed to show an example how to develop a client of a Federated Learning platform.
The example trains a model based on the popular [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist) dataset.
There also exists many scripts to show how to interect with the Federated Learning platform directly.

This project is a component of the Federated Learning (FL) platform, serving as a proof of concept for the [Catena-X](https://catena-x.net/en) project.
The FL platform aims to demonstrate the potential of federated learning in a practical, real-world context.

For a comprehensive understanding of the FL platform, please refer to the official [FL platform documentation](https://dlr-ki.github.io/fl-documentation).

A complete list of all repositories relevant to the FL platform can be found [here](https://dlr-ki.github.io/fl-documentation#repositories).

## Get started

The code of this project is part of the MNIST example client [tutorial](https://dlr-ki.github.io/fl-documentation/tutorial) for the Federated Learning platform.
Hence, this tutorial is a great starting point.

If you just want to test the MNIST example client you can skip the this part of the tutorial and just just to the [ecosystem test](https://dlr-ki.github.io/fl-documentation/tutorial/testing).

Please note, that the MNIST example client is based on the provided [client base](https://github.com/DLR-KI/fl-demonstrator-mnist) package of the Federated Learning platform.
